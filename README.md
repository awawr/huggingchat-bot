# huggingchat-bot

C# Discord chatbot using [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/) and Selenium (Microsoft Edge driver).

The bot only responds to messages from a specified channel. You can set the channel ID in [Program.cs](https://github.com/awawr/huggingchat-bot/blob/main/huggingchat_bot/Program.cs). Responses are trimmed after they exceed the Discord message limit.

*Note: When running the bot, you will have to manually login to your HuggingFace account. The automated browser window is kept visible.*
